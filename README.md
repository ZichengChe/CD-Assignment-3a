### Questions (explored in the Jupyter Notebook file)

**Question 1: Which countries fall into the top and bottom categories based on internet usage in 2018?

The Question 1 aims to explore the countries that exhibit extremes in internet usage. By determining the nations with both the highest and lowest numbers of internet users, we can gain valuable insights into the global distribution of internet adoption.

**Question 2: Is there a correlation between the "Population" and "Internet Users" variables in the dataset? 

The Question 2 aims to offer an overview of two variables, the number of internet users and a country's population, shedding light on how internet usage scales concerning a nation's demographic size.

### Additional Visualization: Areas Distribution of Internet Users
